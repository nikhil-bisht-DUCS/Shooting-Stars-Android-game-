Shooting Stars is a simple 2D side-scrolling game where you have to dodge incoming Fireballs falling from the top.

1) In the Play Mode, you play as Megaman. 
   
Here you have to score points by shooting fireballs.
Also after 30 seconds, Fire-demon enemies will start coming from the left and right sides as well.

2) In the Demo Mode, you can play the early prototype version of the game without any shooting projectile feature of Megaman.

The controls of the game are divided into 2 halves of the screen. Hold left side of the screen to move your character to the left side, and vice-versa.
